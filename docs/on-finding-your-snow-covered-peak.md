###On Finding Your Snow Covered Peak
**_What sets you apart from everyone else?_**

In speaking to my direct reports with reagrd to career trajectory and potential promotions, I've discovered this analogy that I like to use.

I've found it's neccessary for everyone, regardless of position, to find their differentiator. Anyone can be a sufficient programmer, or manager, or product person. There are basics that everyone needs to know - the foundational aspects of the job. You need those to even hope to be average. But how do you get higher ratings? How do propel your career? You need to find your snow covered peak.

What is a snow covered peak, you ask? Once you have the foundational stuff down, that's the mountain. Everyone can build a mountain. Some will be more solid than others, but everyone can build a mountain. The snow covered peak is your differentiator. What differentiates you from everyone else? What makes you stand out? What makes you indispensible?

Some people simply don't have a snow covered peak - and when you look at their mountain, it's obvious - here is no snow at the top. Others have a snow covered peak - and when you look at their mountain, it stands out! They do a particular thing really well and everyone knows they are the person to go to when it comes to that. They are the go-to person for their thing. There is no sense in talking to anyone else. They own the snow that is on their peak. You need their expertise. You need their snow.

One you find what snow needs to cover your peak, you need to dig into it. Make it snow (not rain). Become the expert. Cover the peak with more snow than anyone thought might ever exist there. Become the go-to person. Once you get to that point, use it to propel yourself to the next level - a promotion, a new job, whatever you want - it's your snow!
