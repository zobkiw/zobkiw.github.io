###Always Be Learning
**_Finding the time to learn something new every day_**

If you are in engineering, either as an engineer, developer, or manager, you will (or at least should be) learning something new every day. Sometimes this is by nature of the job - you learn as you go. However, other times you need to carve out time to learn new things.

For example, imagine you work all day writing backend code for your company's API, but you know there is a project coming up that will require you to understand mobile client development in a little more depth. Where does the time come from?

Sometimes you may be lucky enough to have the ability to take dedicated learning time at work. However, this isn't always the case. In these cases, find what works for you. Maybe it's the first hour of the day, before the office gets busy. You can sit with your morning coffee or tea and focus on the new thing you need to learn. Sure, this might take longer, only dedicating an hour a day, but consistency is key here.

One tactic I like to use is scheduling a meeting with myself to perform the task. If I know i have to do something, I find some future time on my calendar and reserve the time. This protects the time from others clobbering it (well, mostly) and allows me to commit to focusing on the required task.

Another thing I have on my calendar is "Ramp Up Time" from 8am-9am and "Wrap Up Time" from 5pm-6pm. These are dedicated, repeating events on my calendar. The work environment is usually quiet during these times and it gives me the opportunity to catch up on work, focus on new learning, clean out my Inbox, prepare for another meeting, etc. I know that every day I have these reserved blocks should the rest of the day go to hell.

####What if I have nothing to learn?

This should never be the case. Well, maybe you have nothing to _have_ to learn, but there is always _something_ to learn - something you can improve on.

Go down the YouTube rabbit hole for a little while. Search for things you're interested in and then see what pops up. There is likely a short video about a thing you didn't know existed. It may be a framework, it may be a technique, it may be something experimental. Even if you don't think it's important or interesting to you, spend the 10 or 20 minutes to learn about it. You never know when it will come in handy.

Another great way to spend this learning time is perusing Github for projects. There are so many amazing things on Github - small projects - large projects - very talented people are creating some incredible things out there. Go learn from them. Read the source code. Read the documentation. Be inspired to create your own thing.
