###Do What Brings You Joy
**_Life is short, but the weekend is shorter_**

As I was settling in this morning with a cup of coffee and Nils Frahm's latest release playing in the background, I have a list a mile long of things I want to do, all at once. I certainly know this is impossible but I want to accomplish them all anyway.

So how do I approach this? I can context switch between them all and do a half-ass job. I can focus on the most important or time-sensitive and let the others wait in line. I can ignore it all and go down a YouTube rabbit hole. So what did I choose?

I decided to write this short piece. It's not the most time-sensitive but it is important. I want to continue to share my thoughts in this format and I can't do that unless I hunt and peck these words onto the screen. To me, this brings me joy. Not only the writing, but also the sharing, and the sense of accomplishment once it's done and people are able to read it.

Over the weekend I will accomplish a few more things - some that are requirements and not neccessarily joyful - like doing my taxes - but I will certainly fit some other joy-inducing tasks in there.
