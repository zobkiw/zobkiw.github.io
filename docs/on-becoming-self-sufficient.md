###On Becoming Self-Sufficient

You need to learn to be self-sufficient.

That basically sums it up. Regardless of what industry you are in, but especially in the world of software engineering, it's important to know your tools and be able to function independently as much as you possibly can.

This is not to say you won't sometimes need assistance. But you must learn the balance between time spent figuring something out yourself and knowing when you are truly stuck or need more input. Learn your personal balance and that of your team. If your team moves fast, your balance needs to be in line with that so you can keep up.

For example, if you have some work that it is expected won't take more than two days and half a day in you are completely lost - it might be time to ask for guidance. I've seen too many junior engineers "spin-out" on things because they *want* to solve it on their own but they simply don't have the experience to do so yet. Then, after they've already surpassed the 2 days, they go asking for help. Then it takes them another 2 days to use the knowledge they've learned. They've doubled the time of the task, essentially wasting most of it. Don't do this - your team and your manager depend on you to get things done - there is a schedule greater than the world you are in with your issue. You have a responsibility to be responsible.

Sometimes the input can come from an internet search or (gasp) an AI. Other times you may need specific information about a process or code unique to your business, which means calling on the local expert there.

####But How?

So, how do you become self-sufficient. The short answer is experience. The longer answer is to learn the tools available to you. Learn the architecture that your systems have been designed around. Learn how all the pieces of your puzzle fit together and function. Learn as much as you can about the world you are working in.

So how do you learn this stuff without asking someone? Read any documentation that might be available. Sometimes this will exist, other times it will not. In the case where there is no documentation, be stealth. Search Slack - join channels that you might not otherwise be interested in and learn from what goes on there. Look at your source control system and eavesdrop on pull requests that aren't in your wheelhouse and learn from the comments and answers there. Join meetings that you might otherwise skip because you're not really needed - if you have the time, join and simply listen and learn.

In short: keep your eyes and ears open at all times!
