###Always Strive To Make Someone Else's Job Easier
**_Coworker, customer, or stranger - look outward_**

Bryan Adams said it best - Everything I do, I do it for you.

I get great satisfaction out of helping others. I don't always have the opportunity to do so in the way you might think, such as volunteering for a cause. However, I know it's important to me and I need to be on the giving side of the equation. So how do I accomplish this in my day to day life?

At work, I manage a strong team of engineers and I am surrounded by a very talented team of others who bring alot to the table. They don't always need my help, but when they do, I'm there. I don't let them down.

If someone asks me for assistance it's due to a combination of reasons that include the fact that they need help and they think I'm the one who can help them. They trust me to help them in their time of need. If they believe in me, then I believe in me - even if I'm not sure at the moment.

This is the reactive way for me, but there is also a proactive way.

When I see something that needs doing, or something that I can take off someone else's plate, I make the effort. Even if they don't know it yet. For example, maybe I know that a coworker needs to clean up some files, but they also don't have time to do it at the moment. Can I help them? Can I write a script to make their job easier? Can I perform the mundane task for them while I'm in need of a mental break? Sure - why not?

This is the modern day equivalent of helping a little old lady cross the street. Only the little old lady could be any of us. Everyone needs a little help now and then. Look outward and be the help they need.
