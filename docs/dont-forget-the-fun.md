###Don't Forget the Fun

I've been working now for 30+ years. If you're in your 20s, don't stop reading, this is important.

Generally speaking, I've worked in jobs that I've enjoyed, with people I admired and respected. However, everything gets stressful here and there. When it's stressful all the time, then we have a problem.

However, now with the majority of a pretty good career behind me, I'm starting to think differently about what is next. Or maybe better said, I'm starting to think for the first time about what is next.

I will always keep a hand in tech, I enjoy it. I'll continue to make music, I enjoy it. I'll probably start reading more. Maybe write some poetry or other short-form.
