###It's OK to Wing It

When I was first learning C back in the late 1980s I had no idea what I was doing. For (literally) at least a month as I was writing code, I would use various combinations of *, ., ->, and ** to access the underlying data in a pointer or handle. I cam from Pascal where you didn't have to worry so much about these things and it was a bit more forgiving. C not so much. If you didn't get it right, it might work for a minute, due to sheer dumb luck, but eventually those bugs would find you.

I was winging it, and this was NOT ok, because I didn't take the time to learn the proper way to do things. I was young. I blame my youth. But today, I take the time to learn before doing.

However, there are times, where there may be something to learn, but the only way to learn is BY doing. In these cases, you sometimes need to wing it. You need to experiment. You need to try things and observe their results. Take notes. Piece the data you are gathering together to end up with the right solution.
