Hello,

I'm Joe.

I’ve been designing and developing software for Apple products since 1986, although it has branched out a bit since then.

I’ve written code and/or managed projects/teams for The Smithsonian, UNESCO, Microsoft, Facebook/Meta, Timehop and many others.

While at Shutterfly, the leading retailer and manufacturing company of high-quality personalized products, I focused on mobile development, platform architecture, and management of development teams.

I've also written two advanced programming books and a third book about career and tech published in April of 2022. You can learn more about it at https://zobskewed.com/

I am capable of melding into a team, turning a team around, and/or managing a project from { to }.

Please contact me if I can be of service to your organization.

PS: Other interests include photography, music, and art.
